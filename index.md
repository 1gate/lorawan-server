<p>
Open-source LoRaWAN Server that integrates both the network-server and the application-server. This is useful for application providers that operate their own LoRa network or for device and application developers.
</p>
<p>
The server:
<ul>
<li>Communicates with remote LoRaWAN gateways.</li>
<li>Performs all required encryption and integrity checks.</li>
<li>Invokes internal modules with application logic.</li>
<li>Invokes external applications connected via the WebSocket protocol.</li>
<li>Supports (any number of) Class A devices.</li>
<li>Supports both the activation by personalization and the over-the-air activation.</li>
<li>Supports both unconfirmed and confirmed data uplink and downlink.</li>
<li>Supports the EU868 and EU433 bands.</li>
<li>Supports per-node configuration of TX power and data rate (manual ADR).</li>
<li>Runs on all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, OS X and Solaris, even in a Docker container.</li>
<li>Is free, distributed under the MIT license.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The server aims to be an all-in-one software package for small private LoRa networks.
However:
<ul>
<li>You still need to buy your LoRaWAN Gateway.</li>
<li>You will need to deploy and maintain it yourself. (With my support.)</li>
<li>It will probably never support the sophisticated management features of the commercial-grade network-servers.</li>
</ul>
